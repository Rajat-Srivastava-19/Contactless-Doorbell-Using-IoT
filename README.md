# Smart Contactless Doorbell Using IoT 🚪🔊

An Arduino-based contactless doorbell system that uses an **ultrasonic sensor** to detect the presence of a visitor near the door. The system eliminates the need for physical touch, making it hygienic, simple, and ideal for smart homes.

## 🛠 Components Used

- Arduino Uno  
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)  
- Buzzer  
- LED (optional)  
- Resistors  
- Breadboard and jumper wires  
- Power supply (USB or adapter)

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The **Ultrasonic Sensor** continuously measures distance.  
2. When someone approaches within a defined range (e.g., 50 cm), the Arduino detects it.  
3. A **buzzer and/or LED** is triggered as a doorbell alert.  
4. The system resets after a short delay and continues scanning.
